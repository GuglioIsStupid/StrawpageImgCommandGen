# strawpagedrawscript
script that uploads an image to that drawing thing on strawpage

Python, Pillow, and CustomTkinter must be installed for the script to work when running via source code. If you are using the .exe file, you do not need to install anything. (I think anyways :P, need to test it)

# how to use (New | Windows):
1. Download either GUI.exe or CLI.exe from the releases page
2. Follow instructions given when you open the .exe file
3. Open Command.txt and copy the text inside, running the result inside the javascript console.

# how to use (New | Linux):
1. Download the source code from the releases page
2. Run `python3 main.py`
3. Follow instructions given when you open the .exe file
4. Open Command.txt and copy the text inside, running the result inside the javascript console.

# how to use (old.script.py):
1. download python file
2. edit the python file with something like visual studio code or idle
3. change the strawpage link to the one that you want to upload the image to
4. change the path to image to the path to your image (make sure its under 900x900)
5. run script
6. a .txt file should appear, copy the stuff inside it
7. go to the strawpage you want to send the image to
8. open inspect element or whatever (ctrl, shift, i) and go to console
9. paste the text that you copied (you might need to allow pasting)
10. press enter
11. if 'empty string' appears at the bottom of the console, it has successfully sent
